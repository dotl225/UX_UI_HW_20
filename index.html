      <h2>Celebration of Lights</h2>
      <h5>Vancouver, Canada: July 23-30, 2022</h5>
      <div class="card mb-3">
        <img src="image/celoflight.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text">One of the city’s signature summer events, the festival lights up the sky over English Bay for three nights at the end of July. Three countries compete each year to wow Vancouver crowds, choreographing their spectacular displays to music as they're launched off a floating barge in the bay. Chrysanthemums, peonies and horsetails explode above the city, with a mighty crack that bounces off the mountains.</p>        </p>
          <p class="card-text">Along with the fireworks themselves, the Celebration of Light kicks off each evening with an accompanying music festival down at Sunset Beach. SHOREFEST is Vancouver’s largest free community concert series. Bands start hitting the stages in the early afternoon, getting crowds warmed up for the spectacular main event.</p>

      <h2>Oktoberfest</h2>
      <h5>Munich, Germany: September 17, 2022 - October 3, 2022</h5>
      <div class="card mb-3">
        <img src="image/okt.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text">Oktoberfest began as the marriage ceremony between Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese on October 12, 1810. All of the townspeople were invited to attend the festival, which took place in the fields outside of the city gates. Following the wedding the fields were named Theresienwiese after the Princess, and the party was such a hit that the townspeople asked King Ludwig to continue the celebration the following year.</p>
          <p class="card-text">Today the remnants of the gates still stand and the fields, known by locals as the Wies’n, now host the largest beer festival in the world: Oktoberfest! What was a simple wedding celebration has transformed into a 17 or 18-day festival in which 7 million people from around the world participate in, consuming more than 6 million liters of Bavarian beer. That’s 1 million gallons of beer! Oktoberfest officially begins on the second to last Saturday in September at noon when the mayor of Munich taps the first barrel at the Schottenhamel Tent, crying "O’zapft is” (It’s open). The festival concludes the first Sunday of October following German reunification day on October 5.</p>

      <h2>Carnival</h2>
      <h5>Rio de Janiero, February , 2023</h5>
      <div class="card mb-3">
        <img src="image/carnival.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text">It’s the main festivity in Brazil which earned the distinction of being “The Greatest Show on Earth.” The Rio Carnival starts on Friday until Tuesday or just a day shy of Ash Wednesday, a significant Catholic tradition which signals the start of Lent. If you really want to understand the question “What is Carnival?”, head off to the Sambodromo particularly on Carnival Sunday and Monday to experience first-hand why this annual tradition is visited by millions of people from all parts of the world.</p>
          <p class="card-text">The top samba schools get the honor of performing in front of millions at the Sambodromo . It’s obvious by watching the performances at the Sambodromo the amount of preparation that goes into each dance step, the choice of song and the selection of dancers to represent each school.</p>

      <h2>Songkran</h2>
      <h5>Bangkok, Thailand: April 13-16, 2023</h5>
      <div class="card mb-3">
        <img src="image/Songkran.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text">It is also known as the water festival. It celebrates water as a ritual of washing away negativity from the year before. People celebrating Songkran take part in a traditional pouring of water that symbolizes washing away back luck and sins from a person’s life. Some people add herbs to the ritual water, as well.</p>
          <p class="card-text">The Songkran Festival is a national holiday in Thailand. It marks the beginning of the Thai New Year. The word Songkran is derived from the Sanskrit work samkranti, which means astrological passage. It is a traditional Buddhist festival, and it is usually celebrated between 13 and 16 April unless the dates are modified by an official government announcement.</p>
